# Beautiful Example

Here is an example of how Beautiful your Kohana apps can be.

**Warning:** Vanity not included.

To get this example up an running via git do the following from your
favourite command line prompt:

```
git clone https://github.com/Beautiful/Example.git beautiful-example
cd beautiful
git update --init --recursive
```

Then set up an web server such as Apache to serve the `public`
directory included in this repository.

Now go to the location in a browser to see the example working.

I advise you check the source.

## What is this for?

This repository is simple a show case of what Beautiful can do for
you. Please excuse the lack of content at the moment, things are
only just getting pretty.
